Eclipse Collections Kata 
===================
A kata is an exercise in martial arts. 
A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps hone your skills through practice and repetition. 
The Eclipse Collections Kata is a fun way to help you learn idiomatic Eclipse Collections usage. 
This particular kata is set up as a series of unit tests which fail. 
Your task is to make them pass, using Eclipse Collections.

Once the project is initialized,
